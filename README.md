Hackathon for Final
# Disease Chosen: Tay-Sachs Disease
## Task C. Underlying Gene
Tay-Sachs is an inherited genetic disorder that is caused by an absence of the enzyme that breaks down gangliosides in the brain. Buildup of these fatty ganglioside substances becomes toxic in the brain and spinal cord and leads to diminished nerve cell function. Tay-Sachs usually shows phenotypic symptoms 3-6 months after birth and can cause muscle weakening, seizures, vision and hearing loss, and paralysis. There is no cure for this disease but supportive care can be administered to lessen symptoms and improve quality of life. Thus, children diagnosed with Tay-Sachs generally live around five years. The diagnostic criteria for this disease is genetic testing for two copies of the HEXA gene, how early symptoms start (infantile, juvenile, and late onset), a cherry red spot in the eye in infants, and family history. The prognostic criteria for infantile form is not good with only 2-4 years to live.  The prognostic criteria for juvenile form is a little more variable with life expectancy to mid-teenage years. The prognostic criteria for late-onset form which has the best prognosis of a normal life expectancy. 
Frontline treatments: 
supportive care (improving day-to-day life)
symptom management (anticonvulsant medication, respiratory care, nutritional support through feeding tubes, physical therapy, medications for pain
Criteria for Successful Treatment:
Symptom relief
Slowing disease progression
Quality of life improvement
Biomarker improvements
Options if frontline therapy fails:
Stem cell transplantation
Substrate reduction therapy (GM2 ganglioside)
Gene Therapy
Pharmaceutical Chaperone Therapy
Combination Therapy
New Clinical Trials
The most notable organ involved in the expression of Tay-Sachs is the brain and spinal cord. This disease causes progressive damage to neurons in the brain and spinal cord.

## Task D. Building a Protein (Cytoscape file)
A PPI is a model that represents the physical interactions between proteins. This can include direct or indirect interactions. This means when proteins are working together. A gene co-expression network, on the other hand, is a network that shows similar expression patterns across different conditions or samples. This has more to do with the expression of the genes than the genes themselves, and does not imply physical interaction between gene products. 
## Task E. Find tissue-specific
An eQTL (expression Quantitative Trait Locus) is a genomic region (a locus) containing a DNA variation that influences the expression levels of one or more genes. In simpler terms, an eQTL is a genetic variant that affects how much a particular gene is expressed (how much RNA or protein is produced from that gene).

In the context of the human organism, eQTLs play a critical role in understanding the relationship between genetic variations and biological processes, including the development of diseases and traits.
